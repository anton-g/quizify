# Quizify

ðŸ’ƒ Quizify is a real time multiplayer music quiz where any browser is a buzzer ðŸ•º

It's made up of two parts; a server written in [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/) and a client written with [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue).

It is very much a work in progress, but if you'd like you can set up it up and run it yourself. Besides the server and client you'll also need to run a local [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com) instance.

## Server

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve at localhost:3000
npm run start

# serve with nodemon at localhost:3000
npm run start:watch

# run unit tests
npm run test
```

## Client

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
